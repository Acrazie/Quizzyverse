### Project Objective
The goal of this project is to use all the tools learned during the course and apply them in a single site, Quizzyverse. The site should allow users to select a quiz of their choice, play it, and receive a score at the end. A ranking system is also planned. The major feature of this site is the independent management of each quiz. The team aims to have 4 quizzes available on the site.

### Specifics
- Limit of 4 quizzes per day, resetting at midnight.
- Premium accounts allow unlimited quizzes per day and you can create your own quiz.
- XP is awarded for each quiz submission, equivalent to 50 XP per quiz if all answers are correct.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/EpitechCodingAcademyPromo2024/C-COD-260-PAR-2-2-ecp-marc-alexandre.lepinard/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
